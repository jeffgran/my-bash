! This file lets us use R-Alt as the Hyper key, while leaving the L-Alt key as Alt
! Place this file at ~/.Xmodmap
! It will automatically get picked up on login. To run it for the first time, `xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap`



! clear the alt completely
! (unassign Alt_R from being understood as Alt)
clear mod1
! clear the super/hyper completely
! (By default Super and Hyper are both understood as Super, which is mod4. We want to remove Hyper_R from being undrstood as Super)
clear mod4
! clear mod3 - it is empty by default but this makes this idempotent
clear mod3



! The keycode 108 (which is what my R_Alt key sends) is understood as Hyper_R
keycode 108 = Hyper_R

! Hyper_R (which now includes keycode 108 which is my physical Alt_R key) is mod3, a different modifier. By default mod3 is blank
add mod3 = Hyper_R
add mod4 = Super_L Hyper_L Super_R
add mod1 = Alt_L Meta_L


! clear capslock and control to remap capslock to control
! from https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/xmodmap#Turn_CapsLock_into_Control
clear lock
clear control
! map 66 (capslock physical key) as a control key then reassign control to be interpreted as control
keycode 66 = Control_L
add control = Control_L Control_R
